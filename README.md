# Code Quiz

## Description

As a student in the beginning stages of learning Javascript, grasping the basic understandings and concepts are essential to the rest of the learning journey. This project was built to test the user on the basic syntax knowledge used in Javascript. For those students starting to learn Javascript but having a tough time remembering the syntax structures used frequently. This code quiz will help the user remember the correct or incorrect use of syntax. During this project I learned the use of event listeners and how to store user input or any other information in the local storage.
